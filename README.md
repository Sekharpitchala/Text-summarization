# Text-summarization using pipeline function 

# Description:

This repository presents a Python-based text summarization pipeline utilizing the [Pipeline Library Name] library and the pre-trained [Summarization Model Name] model. The pipeline is designed to efficiently condense long text documents into concise and informative summaries while preserving key information.

# Key Features:

Modular Pipeline: The pipeline architecture is modular, allowing for easy customization and integration with other NLP tasks.
State-of-the-Art Model: The [Summarization Model Name] model is a leading choice for text summarization, known for its accuracy and robustness.
Parameter Tuning: The pipeline offers flexibility in adjusting parameters like maximum summary length, language, and model weights to tailor the output to specific requirements.
User-Friendly Interface: The pipeline provides a simple API, making it accessible to developers and non-experts alike.


# Usage:

#Installation:
  Bash
  pip install [Required Libraries]
  Use code with caution.

# Import:
  Python
  from summarizer import summarize
  Use code with caution.

# Summarize Text:
 Python
 text = "Your long text here"
 summary = summarize(text, max_summary_length=100, language="en")
 print(summary)
 
# Customization Options:

Maximum Summary Length: Control the length of the generated summary.
Language: Specify the language of the input text.
Model Weights: Experiment with different model weights to fine-tune the summarization process
